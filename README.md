## To run the model for detecting the citrus leaf disease:
  -  Download the dataset from the above directory
  -  Modify the datapath on the cnntuning.ipynb file
  -  Run each cell on the jupyter notebook as the order: 
      - import package cells
      - load data cells
      - define model cells (the better model right now is model2)
      - model compile cell => model fit cell => model evaluate cell => model save cell
